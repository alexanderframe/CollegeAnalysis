# CollegeAnalysis

Using data from the College Scorecard API, we identify a handful of specific metrics out of ~2,000 that we want to explore.  

Our goal is to uncover any patterns or trends in the data that can help prospective college students and parents determine which is the right school for their specific situation.

Images of different plots and charts that we make are located in the folder titled "Images".
Analysis code created by individual team members can be found in the folder titled "Analysis Files".
Our main script with each individual team members code combined into one notebook file is titled "University Collection.ipynb"
